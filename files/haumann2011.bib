  abstract = {Sea ice that covers large parts of the polar oceans throughout most
	of the year responds to changes in the atmosphere or the ocean within
	a short period of time. The rapid decrease of the Arctic sea ice
	cover in the past decades has led to a fundamental discussion of
	the role of sea ice in the climate system. Surprisingly, in contrast
	to the northern hemisphere, the sea ice in the  Southern Ocean has
	been slightly increasing over the last decades. This is owing to
	essentially different processes that take place around Antarctica.
	There, the ice is not confined to a basin as in the Arctic Ocean
	but can move rather freely around the Antarctic continent which results
	in a strong response to changes in the wind field.
	
	
	In this Master's thesis I examined the impact of the variations in
	the coastal Antarctic atmospheric boundary layer on the sea ice.
	By studying wind driven sea ice transport in the Southern Ocean and
	temporal and spatial variabilities in the period 1989 to 2006, I
	have revealed important characteristics of the sea ice cover and
	processes that determine its growth and decay. The near surface wind
	field over the coastal continent and ocean as well as its forcing
	mechanisms were described in detail by using output from a regional
	atmospheric climate model. This showed strong relations to key parameters
	that I have deduced from a satellite record of sea ice concentration
	and sea ice motion.
	
	
	The regions of the largest sea ice extent, the Ross and Weddell Seas,
	are also those areas where most of the sea ice transport takes place
	and where its variability is the largest. Interannual variations
	and trends of transport are associated with varying sea ice concentration
	just north of these areas in the Ross and Weddell Seas. Comparing
	the wind field and the sea ice motion, I found out that spatial patterns
	of persistent southerly or south-easterly winds coincide with those
	of ice drift. The winds in these regions result from combined effects
	of the large-scale pressure distribution, cold air that accumulates
	over the ice shelves, and large topographic barriers that alter the
	flow. Adjacent to the large Ross and Ronne-Filchner Ice Shelves constant
	outflow of cold air takes place almost year-round. Here, sea ice
	is constantly exported from the coastal region, and large polynyas
	and leads form. As the cold winds not only lead to sea ice transport
	but also support refreezing of the open water, these areas are associated
	with strong sea ice formation. I have defined an index that captures
	the outflow of cold continental air from the ice shelves. The long-term
	variations in outflow correlate well with variations of the sea ice
	cover and meridional sea ice transport in the Ross and western Weddell
	Seas. Further, the results suggest that the positive trend of sea
	ice cover in western Ross Sea and the negative trend in the western
	Weddell Sea are related to a respective seasonal increase and decrease
	of cold air outflow. Overall, in my thesis, I showed that the dynamical
	interaction between the atmospheric boundary layer and the sea ice
	is a regional key element in the interannual variability and the
	long-term changes of the sea ice cover in the Southern Ocean.},
